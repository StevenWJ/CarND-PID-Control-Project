    "## Project Goal\n",
    "In this project, I implemented a PID (proportional–integral–derivative) controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the lake race track from the Behavioral Cloning Project. A typical PID controller contains three terms:\n",
    "* Term P is proportional to the current value of the SP − PV error e(t).\n",
    "* Term I accounts for past values of the SP − PV error and integrates them over time to produce the I term\n",
    "* Term D is a best estimate of the future trend of the SP − PV error, based on its current rate of change\n",

    "### Picking the initial PID parameters\n",
    "In this project, I created two PID controllers.  One of which is controling steering wheel while the other one is responsible for throttle.  \n",
    "* Steering wheel controller\n",
    "The steering wheel controller use PID parameter $[0.109901, 0.0388477, 0.591048]$ which was previous generated by Twiddle as a starting point.  The would reduce the change of the vehicle driving out of road when the Twiddle is manipulating PID parameter.  In this case, $[0, 0, 0]$ is not a good starting point since the output will be zero for a while before Twiddle actually pick a non-zero value for P parameter.  In that time, vehicle will drive out of the road.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Throttle controller\n",
    "In this project I enable another PID controller for throttle which use pretuned PID parameters $[0.11, 0.0, 0.0]$ and disable Twiddle for it for better acceleration at the beginning.  Enabling Twiddle for throttle controller in this case caused the vehicle to drive slower but smoother.  However, it sometime hit a bug of the simulator in which the simulator stopped responding to any json messages sent to it.  The car simply stalled on the road without hitting any obstacle.  A demo clip with Twiddle turned on for throttle controller is [here](https://youtu.be/cqs7WJ2B4Ig).\n",
    "Not like steering controller which uses Cross Track Error, CTE (in this case, s_cte), received from the simulator directly.  The throttle controller combined CTE in an equation to create its CTE (v_cte).  When `v_cte` is a negative value, it will be divided by 100.0 to make the amplitude way more smaller than a positive value will be.  This can prevent `v_cte` from being a large negative value that might cause the vehicle to back up.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "double delta_speed = speed - pid.target_speed;\n",
    "double v_cte = ((delta_speed/pid.target_speed)/exp(fabs(s_cte)) + fabs(s_cte)*0.1)*20.0;\n",
    "if (v_cte > 0.0) { v_cte /= 100.0; }\n",
    "```    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Enabling Twiddle \n",
    "Since both steering and throttle controller's values are between $-1$ and $1$ which are small value, setting `dp` to $[1, 1, 1]$ is not practical due to big value changes. In this project, I set $dp = [0.099, 0.0099, 0.00099]$ to make sure it doesn't cause big changes in the output values hece driving the vehicle up to the curbs.  Furthermore, it also ensure the additions or subtractions to the parameters will not make it zeros which will totally disable the PID controller.    \n",
